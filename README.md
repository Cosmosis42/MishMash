# MishMash
A great big general mish mash

En route to the Small Magellanic Cloud, your ship has been waylaid in the Mish nebula.  Although it is known to be the fastest route to the Magellanic Cloud colonies, it has a dark reputation.  Since entering it your ship has been plagued navigational and long range sensor errors.  The ships supply of Opperdoeze Ronde Potatoes dwindles as your crew feeds off the mash.  Will you make it through the spooky Mish Nebula?
